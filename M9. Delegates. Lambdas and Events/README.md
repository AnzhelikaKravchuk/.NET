## Tasks  
**Objective:** 
- *understand delegate usage scenarios;*
- *understand the relationship delegates versus interfaces;*
- *understand callback functions;*
- *study design pattern Observer;*
- *understand difference between events and delegates;*
- *understand DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), SoC (Separation of Concerns principles), Low Coupling principles;*
- *write agile extensible testable code;*
- *understand standard event delegate pattern.*

1. Refactor of class methods [Task 2 Module 4](https://github.com/EPM-RD-NETLAB/.NET-Framework-modules/tree/master/M4.%20Methods%20in%20details) using delegates (the API's of the class should not change). 
2. Add to the class [Task 2 Module 3](https://github.com/EPM-RD-NETLAB/.NET-Framework-modules/tree/master/M3.%20Types) new methods with custom delegete, allowing to sorting both in ascending and descending, depending on comparison criterion of the matrix rows. Develop unit-tests using various comparison criterion of the matrix rows. 
3. Develop a Countdown class, which implements the capability after the appointed time (waiting time is provided by the user) to transmit a message to any subscriber who subscribes to the event. You can use the Thread.Sleep method to create a wait effect. Provide the possibility of subscribing to an event in several classes. Use the console application for testing.
