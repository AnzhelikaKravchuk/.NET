## Tasks 
**Objective:** 
- *study extension methods;* 
- *study the format of IEEE 754.* 

1. Implement a binary representation of a real double-precision number in IEEE 754 format as the extension method. 
2. Develop a class that allows performing Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) computations using Euclid's algorithm for two, three, etc. of integers. The methods of class should be able to determine the GCD calculation time (consider three possible oportunities for returning more than one value from the method). Add to the class methods that implement the Stein algorithm (Euclid's binary algorithm) to calculate GCD of two, three, etc. of integers. These methods should be able to determine the GCD calculation time too.
3. Write two basic extention methods: SayHello and SayGoodbye. 
   Examples: string name = "Kathy"
    - name.SayHello() --> "Hello, Kathy!"
    - name.SayGoodbye() --> "Goodbye, Kathy. See you again soon!"
